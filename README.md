![pH scale](https://blog.jencoi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/103211917_m.jpg?width=1200&name=103211917_m.jpg)

The data includes **3276 water** samples and **10 features** , incl.

- **pH** is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 - 14, with 7 being neutral. WHO has recommended maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5
- **Hardness** Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L
- **Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS)** represents the total concentration of dissolved substances in water.
- **Chloramines** are disinfectants used to treat drinking water.
- **Sulfate** Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L
- **Conductivity** Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm
- **Organic_carbon** Amount of organic carbon in ppm
- **Trihalomethanes** Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L
- **Turbidity** Measure of light emiting property of water in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units)
- **Potability** Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.
